# Market Watch

A clean single-page app that plugs into the iextrading API to retrieve data on the stock market, and uses Firebase, a serverless database, to add and remove favorites. As an end user you're easily able to search companies by sector or find a specific company by their ticker, and add and remove companies from your favorites. A detailed view of the company provides you with a short description, stock price, graph, and news.
